    "The difficulty with BLG is that its band structure is dependent upon the potential difference between the layers. When measuring a sample of BLG with an STM tip, one typically sweeps over many different values of tip voltage. Thus the act of measuring the band structure changes the band structure itself. In order to account for this, I have developed adapted an electrostatic model from previous works which will determine the equilibrium values of the voltages on the layers of BLG. We can then compute the tunneling current between the BLG and tip"
